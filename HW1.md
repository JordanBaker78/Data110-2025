#### About Me
I am a young 19 year old college student at my third semester at MC (I did not take classes last spring semester). I am a Data Science major and my favorite subject is math. I chose _Data Science_ as my major because I like specifically _**Data Analysis**_, but _Data Science_ is what is offered at MC.

#### List of my Favorite Things
1. Reading
2. Math
3. Youtube
4. Sports
##### Honorable Mentions
- Psychology
- Cars
- Food
- Video Games
